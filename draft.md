Hi, I'm Linh Linh Luong a graphic designer and illustrator based in Prague. 
I believe every brand has a story waiting to be told visually. 
My approach is to create designs that resonate, combining bold concepts with unique artistry.
From logos to illustrations, I'm all about making designs that connect and inspire. 
Let's meet up over a warm cup of coffee and share our visions!
