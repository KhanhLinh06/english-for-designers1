1. Design for people, Not products:
- prioritizing human experienxe in creating a design, make solutions that improve lives not just aesthetics

2. Less is more:
- embrace minimalis, the power of design lies in what is essential

3. Reject trends, Timelessness Rules!
- trends come and go, focus on creating work that resonates across time

4. Art has NO boundaries:
- there are no limits for creativity and imaginary

5. Trust the process:
- embrace the chaos and uncertainty of creation, everything will end up nicely, fake til u make it haha
